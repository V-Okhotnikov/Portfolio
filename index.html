    <h1>Portfolio: Expert in Equipment Integrity Management and Non-Destructive Testing</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As an expert in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and Equipment Integrity Management, I possess extensive knowledge and experience in various fields, including welding, pressure vessels, boilers, tanks, heat exchangers, and pipelines. My expertise covers multiple aspects such as flange management, flexible hoses, pressure relief devices, check valves, and rupture discs. I also specialize in Risk-Based Inspection (RBI) and the application of various standards such as API and ASME.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Qualifications and Standards</h2>
        <p>I am trained in accordance with a range of API standards, including 510, 520, 570, 571, 574, 576, 579, 580, 581, 598, and 653, as well as ASME B31.3, 16.5, and BPVC V, VIII, IX. These qualifications enable me to conduct comprehensive inspections and ensure compliance with safety and quality requirements in the oil and gas, chemical, and energy industries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Integrity and Corrosion Management</h2>
        <p>My experience in equipment integrity management includes the use of methods such as Shell-RBI, AMS, and w-IMS, as well as the development and implementation of a Corrosion Management Framework. I have worked with various components and equipment, including critical elements, inspection schedules, operation histories, and risk matrices. My work also covers consequence analysis, confidence and risk mitigation, as well as life cycle management and maintenance planning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Technical Skills and Methods</h2>
        <p>I have extensive knowledge in corrosion, including CUI, cracking, weld defects, mechanical damage, leaks, embrittlement, and fatigue. My skills in non-destructive testing include visual inspection (VT), ultrasonic testing (UT/PAUT/TOFD/LRUT), electromagnetic testing (EMAT), radiographic testing (RT/DRT/RTR), and many others. I am also proficient in modern technologies such as remote experts, augmented and virtual reality, digital twins, and machine learning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Equipment and Materials</h2>
        <p>I have worked with various materials, such as carbon steel, stainless steel, duplex steel, galvanized steel, 6Mo, titanium, and HDPE. My experience includes the application of analysis methods such as PMI/XRF, hardness, tensile, and impact tests, as well as the use of analysis software such as ANSYS and Solidworks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
        <p>My experience covers both onshore and offshore production facilities, including booster stations, LNG terminals, and oil terminals, as well as pipelines and gas distribution networks. I have successfully implemented projects related to maintenance, repair, and modifications, including the updating of drawings, isometric diagrams, and P&IDs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Innovation and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>I have also actively improved my qualification in renewable energy projects, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and energy storage technologies. My experience in digitalization and process automation allows me to use modern technologies to enhance efficiency and safety.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>My portfolio demonstrates a wide range of skills and experience in non-destructive testing, equipment integrity management, and corrosion. I am committed to continuous development and the application of advanced technologies to ensure safety and reliability in the oil and gas, chemical, and energy industries.</p>
